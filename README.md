# username-availability-checker


I know that most of the users today sign up with their Facebook or Gmail account. But to increase the sign up rate, it is also important to pay attention in manual registration process as well.

Providing a unique username is something that every registration form includes, but sometimes, visitors need to verify if their desired username is available or not.

Therefore, I thought why don’t a make a simple demo about it. I’ve written an article on [How to implement check username availability feature](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/integrate-check-username-availability-feature-ajax-jquery/) in your registration that can help you implement it in your PHP website.
